## Model Review

The XGBoost classifier was trained and optimized on the Invisistico Airlines dataset to predict passenger satisfaction. The model achieved a test accuracy of **95.85%**, demonstrating strong predictive capability. Cross-validation yielded an average accuracy of **75.7%**, confirming good generalization.

Class imbalance was addressed using appropriate weighting, ensuring balanced performance for both satisfied and dissatisfied passengers. Compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest models tested, XGBoost provided the best overall accuracy and training efficiency.

Integrated into the web app backend, this model enables real-time satisfaction predictions from passenger inputs. This AI-powered solution empowers airlines to improve customer experience, tailor services, and make data-driven operational decisions.
